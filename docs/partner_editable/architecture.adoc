As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the public subnet, a managed NAT gateway to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnet.
* In the public subnet, a Linux bastion host to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.
* In the private subnet, a Dell Boomi Atom installed on an Amazon EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2.
* An Amazon Cloudwatch alarm for auto-recovery in case of instance failure.
