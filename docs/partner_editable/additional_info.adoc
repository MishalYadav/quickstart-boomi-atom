== Test the deployment

To navigate to the Boomi Atom Dashboard, https://platform.boomi.com/[log
in] to your Dell Boomi account and navigate to the *Manage* drop-down
menu. Select *Atom Management* to see the Atoms in your account. The
newly created AWS EC2 instance Atom server will be displayed here. You
can then attach the AWS EC2 instance Atom to any environment you have
staged and deploy workloads to that Atom.

== Best practices for using {partner-product-short-name} on AWS

The Dell Boomi Atom that is deployed on AWS can be managed in the Dell
Boomi Dashboard just as any other Atom is managed. Atoms can be attached
to environments within an account and can have workloads deployed to
them in those environments.

In <<deployed-atom>>, a Dell Boomi Atom server has been deployed in a Dell Boomi
account through this Quick Start. The Atom server is identified by the
DNS name `ip-172-30-7.186.ec2.internal`. The account contains two Dell
Boomi environments: one labeled Production and the other labeled Test:

== Security

This Quick Start deploys a bastion host and a Dell Boomi Atom server
into an AWS VPC. The bastion host is the only means of accessing the
Dell Boomi Atom server at a command line level. The Dell Boomi Atom
server is deployed into a private subnet and cannot be reached through
the internet. The Boomi Atom server communicates through a NAT Gateway
for updates and patches.

== Performance Monitoring

Monitoring the CPU, network, and Amazon EBS performance of your AWS Dell
Boomi Atom is done through Amazon CloudWatch metrics.

CPU and network performance is measured in utilization, network in and
out, network packets in and out, and system status checks.

Amazon EBS volume performance is measured in read and write throughput,
average read and write size, read and write bandwidth, read and write
latency, and volume idle time.

Further monitoring of disk space and inode consumption must be performed
at the command line level of the EC2 instance using the `df -h` and `df -i`
Linux commands.
