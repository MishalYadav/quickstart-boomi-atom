This Quick Start requires an account with Dell Boomi. The Dell Boomi
account used to stage this Quick Start will determine the licensing
model that applies. Licensing costs will be managed by Dell Boomi, and
Dell Boomi will apply standard connector metering charges to workloads
that use a Dell Boomi account to run on this Atom. This Quick Start can
also be used to deploy a Dell Boomi Atom server that will run trial or
training workloads.
